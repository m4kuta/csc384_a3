steps
    define variables
    preprocess
    solve csp
        select var
            heuristics
        assign var

define variables using dictionaries (or lists)
    id
    domain
    assignment
    value

    current versions?

preprocessing
    rowMax == 0 => all water row
    colMax == 0 => all water col
    given piece => water adjacency
    remove left from domain in right column
    remove right from domain in left column
    remove top from domain in bottom column
    remove bottom from domain in top column

select var

heuristic
    select square in row/col combo that has highest sum <= max
    squares surrounded by
        4 W
            either S or W
        3 W and 1 piece
            either piece or W

assign var
    constraints are in here atm, move out

constraints
    row constraint
        piece count
        water count
    col constraint
        piece count
        water count

    piece constraint
        piece count

    M constraint
        cant be surrounded by W on two sides not in same col/row
