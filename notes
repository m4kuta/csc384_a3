preprocessing
    rowMax == 0 => all water row
    colMax == 0 => all water col
    given piece => water adjacency

select var


heuristic
    select square in row/col combo that has highest sum <= max
    squares surrounded by
        4 W
            either S or W
        3 W and 1 piece
            either piece or W

constraints
    row constraint
        piece count
        water count
    col constraint
        piece count
        water count

    piece constraint
        piece count
