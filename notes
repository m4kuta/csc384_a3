preprocessing
    rowMax == 0 => all water row
    colMax == 0 => all water col
    given piece => water adjacency

select var

heuristic
    select square in row/col combo that has highest sum <= max

constraints
    row max constraint
    col max constraint

    ship sum constraint
    piece sum constraint

    waterAdj constraint
